# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Began working on FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Project Daily Quote machine.

**Thoughts** It's been some time since I worked on FreeCodeCamp.  I enjoy this site.  My current role has me mostly doing backk end so I really enjoy doing front end.  I currently have my work on codepen.io and will move it over to its own github repository.  Definitely a work in progress.
