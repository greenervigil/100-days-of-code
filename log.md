# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: October 14, Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Began updating my personal website which I had not worked on in some time.

**Thoughts** I made a lot of changes to the formatting.  Had to make a lot of corrections since my original was done on codepen.  I needed to get to a point where everything was working locally since codepen takes a lot of the basic formatting out of the picture.    

### Day 2: October 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on my personal website.  trying to come up with some design ideas while cleaning up the code.    

**Thoughts** I am not a designer at all.  This is something that I will probably always struggle with.  Trying to determine the best approach to the design of my site.  Alos looking at all of the information I have on different sites and trying to incorporate all of them as examples.  




<!--### Day 3: January 5, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Complete Major Element challenge in Java for CodeEval and worked on the challenge Chardonnay or Cabernet challenge but did not complete it.    
**Thoughts** In doing some reading on [Medium](Medium.com), I read an artice on preparing for a google interview which I am very interested in going through.  The repository is located [here](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university).  There are a lot of resources, nice refresher.
