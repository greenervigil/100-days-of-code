# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Began working on FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Project Daily Quote machine.

**Thoughts** It's been some time since I worked on FreeCodeCamp.  I enjoy this site.  My current role has me mostly doing backk end so I really enjoy doing front end.  I currently have my work on codepen.io and will move it over to its own github repository.  Definitely a work in progress.

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Gave my freecodecamp Daily quote project a repo.  Did not really feel like working on the project so I did the code challenge One Zero, Two Zeros... in Java and posted to Github and  posted completion on twitter.  

**Thoughts** The challenge took some time but I was surprised and happy with how quickly I was able to determine the direction I needed to go to solve it.

### Day 3: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Complete Major Element challenge in Java for CodeEval and worked on the challenge Chardonnay or Cabernet challenge but did not complete it.    

**Thoughts** In doing some reading on [Medium](Medium.com), I read an artice on preparing for a google interview which I am very interested in going through.  The repository is located [here](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university).  There are a lot of resources, nice refresher.
