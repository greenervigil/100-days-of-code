# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Began working on FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Project Daily Quote machine.

**Thoughts** It's been some time since I worked on FreeCodeCamp.  I enjoy this site.  My current role has me mostly doing backk end so I really enjoy doing front end.  I currently have my work on codepen.io and will move it over to its own github repository.  Definitely a work in progress.

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Gave my freecodecamp Daily quote project a repo.  Did not really feel like working on the project so I did the code challenge One Zero, Two Zeros... in Java and posted to Github and  posted completion on twitter.  

**Thoughts** The challenge took some time but I was surprised and happy with how quickly I was able to determine the direction I needed to go to solve it.

### Day 3: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Complete Major Element challenge in Java for CodeEval and worked on the challenge Chardonnay or Cabernet challenge but did not complete it.    

**Thoughts** In doing some reading on [Medium](Medium.com), I read an artice on preparing for a google interview which I am very interested in going through.  The repository is located [here](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university).  There are a lot of resources, nice refresher.

### Day 4: January 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the challenge Chardonnay or Cabernet challenge but stil did not complete it.    

**Thoughts** Friday, I worked two jobs which meant I had no time to write code outside of work.  I also took the weekend off as I feel making sure you get time to unwind and step out of your head is extremely important. Also worked on the codeeval challenge Read More which I have received partial credit on so I will also work on getting that completed as well.  The only problem with codeeval and their challenges are when you patially get the answer.  They do not show you the output so you can figure out where you went wrong, or allow you to obtain the test cases they used so you may also use them in your testing.  You can get the test cases when you solve or miss it completely.

### Day 5: January 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the Words to Digits challenge on CodeEval and pushed my solution to my repo.  Outside of coding I have been working on the [Algorithms Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome) course and reading the book which I was able to find in pdf online.   

**Thoughts** This challenge I found to be pretty easy. The great thing about CodeEval is that no one else will be able to just copy my solutions as it measures the uniqueness of your code.  I will also begin using [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) more to practice additional challenges.

### Day 6: January 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some code challenges for codeeval.  Outside of coding I have been working on the [Algorithms Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome) course and reading the book which I was able to find in pdf online.   

**Thoughts** Today was a pretty lull day.  I did a lot of coding at work so was rather tired from that.  Still managed to do a full hour outside of work.

### Day 7: January 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Bit Position code challenge for codeeval.  Started working with BitSets but could not seem to get it to work properly.  Outside of coding I have been working on the [Algorithms Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome) course and reading the book which I was able to find in pdf online.  I also started the AI course on [Edx](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ColumbiaX+CSMM.101x+1T2017/info) 

**Thoughts** Not too bad of a day.  I did complete the weeks coursework in the AI course and all of the lectures in the Algorithm course.  There is a homework assignment which may take up a lot of time which  I hope I can use for this challenge.  It is a percolation algorithm assignment.

### Day 8: January 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Bit Position code challenge, the Wines challenge, and the Read More challenge for codeeval.  Started working with BitSets but could not seem to get it to work properly.  Outside of coding I have been working on the [Algorithms Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome) course and reading the book which I was able to find in pdf online.  I am working on the first assignment which is a percolation algorithm.  Finished up the first week videos and quiz for the AI course on [Edx](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ColumbiaX+CSMM.101x+1T2017/info) 

**Thoughts** It is surprising how quickly an hour can go by.  Especially when you are stuck.  I managed to make some head way on the codeeval challenges.  I plan to move away from those for a bit and work on the Java Web Developer nano Degree I signed up for.  I am on the second project which is building a Soccer League Organizer.  I walked away from this for a bit because I was stuying for the OCA exam, but I think it is time to return.
