# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: October 14, Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Began updating my personal website which I had not worked on in some time.

**Thoughts** I made a lot of changes to the formatting.  Had to make a lot of corrections since my original was done on codepen.  I needed to get to a point where everything was working locally since codepen takes a lot of the basic formatting out of the picture.

### Day 2: October 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on my personal website.  trying to come up with some design ideas while cleaning up the code.    

**Thoughts** I am not a designer at all.  This is something that I will probably always struggle with.  Trying to determine the best approach to the design of my site.  Alos looking at all of the information I have on different sites and trying to incorporate all of them as examples.  Thinking about domain names and where to host my site.  I already have a year free with ecowebhosting.co.uk but not sure that will work best for me since I am in the US.  But I do want to move to the UK.  So maybe.
